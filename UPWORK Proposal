Hello Sir,
I'd really like to work with you on this one if possible! I do have a couple of questions, but first I'd like to make you an offer and some background so you can check my work out.

My name is Salman and I am a Full-Stack Developer with nearly 4 years of experience, with 2 of those years in e-commerce inventory management developed with Laravel. So I am pretty familiar with what you need doing.

However, I am new to upwork and looking to get a few clients that I can build upon. If you take a look at my work and feel that I could help you.

You'll get all the expected stuff like a great professional service and a fast turn around, at a bit less, and I get a bit more exposure.


The question that I have is how many modules do you want within 24 hours. such as 
1. Product module which  mainly do product add, edit, delete/remove and add stock( or separate module for stock/order).
2. Delivery module for delivering product and re-adjust stock.
3. and re-order module for calculating reorder quantity and send notification to users/clients.

If you would be interested in, I'd love to hear from you.
Regards,
Salman
